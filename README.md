# EnriChR
Enrichment of Conditions in R.

# Usage
EnriChR is an R Shiny app that interfaces with [Gemma](https://gemma.msl.ubc.ca). It provides users with ability to search using their gene set to determine if those genes have a statistically significant association with a condition-comparison contrast. This is done by ranking experiments in which one or several of the query genes have been found as differentially expressed and reporting the enrichment of the experiments' associated ontology terms against those contained in the entire corpus.
