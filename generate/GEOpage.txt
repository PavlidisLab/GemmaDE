Transcriptomic analysis of biofilm formation in persistent and transient Listeria monocytogenes from the retail deli environment
(Submitter supplied) Persistence of Listeria monocytogenes in retail deli environments is a serious food safety issue, potentially leading to cross-contamination of ready-to-eat foods such as deli meats, salads, and cheeses. We previously discovered strong evidence of L. monocytogenes persistence in delis across multiple states. We hypothesized that this was correlated with isolates’ innate characteristics, such as biofilm-forming capacity or gene differences.We further chose four isolates for RNA-sequencing analysis and compared their global biofilm transcriptome to their global planktonic transcriptome. more...

Mice deficient in Zfp871 are prone to early death and steatohepatitis in part through the p53-Mdm2 axis
(Submitter supplied) p53 transcription factor is activated upon exposure to various cellular stresses, leading to growth suppression. However, aberrant activation of p53 can lead to defects in embryonic development and other abnormalities. Here, we identified zinc finger protein Zfp871 as a p53 target gene. We showed that as an RNA-binding protein, Zfp871 binds to Mdm2 3’UTR and stabilizes Mdm2 mRNA, which in turn suppresses p53 expression through increased expression of Mdm2 E3 ubiquitin ligase. more...

A prion accelerates proliferation at the expense of lifespan [samples with spike-in controls]
(Submitter supplied) Manuscript abstract: In fluctuating environments, the ability to switch between different growth strategies, such as those affecting cell size and proliferation, can be advantageous to an organism. Tradeoffs arise, however. Mechanisms that aberrantly increase cell size or proliferation— such as mutations, or chemicals that interfere with growth regulatory pathways—can also shorten lifespan. Here we report a natural example of how the interplay between growth and lifespan can be epigenetically controlled. more...

Inhibition of the IL-17A axis Protects against Immune-related Adverse Events while Supporting Checkpoint Inhibitor Anti-tumor Efficacy
(Submitter supplied) Checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) immunotherapy leverages the body’s own immune system to attack cancer cells but leads to unwanted autoimmune side effects in up to 60% of patients. Such immune related adverse events (IrAE) lead to treatment interruption, permanent organ dysfunction, hospitalization and premature death. Thyroiditis is one of the most common IrAE, but the cause of thyroid IrAE remains unknown. more...

Histone H3K27me3 demethylase act as a regulator of stemness in hypoxic cancer cells that are detached from extracellular matrix
(Submitter supplied) Metastasis of cancer cells requires detachment from Extra Cellular Matrix (ECM) to seed cancer cells in a distant organ. Hypoxia is prevalent in this matrix detached cancer cells. Studies have established hypoxia as a chromatin modifier, as it transcriptionally controls expression of various histone demethylases (KDMs); therefore, we hypothesized that the presence of hypoxia could modulate the expression of KDMs in matrix detached cancer cells. more...

A mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid oxidation defect leads to uncharged tRNA accumulation and activation of the integrated stress response in the mouse heart
(Submitter supplied) The heart relies mainly on mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation (FAO) for its high energy requirements. Cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias can be severe complications in patients with inherited defects in mitochondrial long-chain FAO, reinforcing the importance of FAO for cardiac health. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie the cardiac abnormalities in long-chain FAO disorders remain largely unknown. more...

Deacetylation of HP1g enhances multiple myeloma drug resistance through DNA damage repair and liquid-liquid phase separation (RNA-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) Functional crosstalk between histone modifications and chromatin remodeling has emerged as a key regulatory mode of transcriptional control during drug resistance, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that HP1g regulates chromatin dynamic and gene transcription during drug resistance in multiple myeloma. To study the cellular and molecular function of HP1g during bortezomib resistance, we used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to generate gene expression profiling under HP1g steady overexpression in LP-1. more...

SNP rs4971059 Predisposes to Breast Carcinogenesis and Chemoresistance by Powering DNA Replication [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Identification of the driving force behind malignant transformation holds the promise to combat the relapse and therapeutic resistance of cancer. We report here that the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4971059, one of the 65 new breast cancer risk loci identified in a recent genome-wide association analysis, locates at the 6th intron of TRIM46 that functions as an active enhancer. We find that G to A polymorphic switch of the rs4971059 allele augments its chromosomal interaction with the promoter and boosts its enhancer activity. more...

scRNAseq and TCRseq of hepatic and splenic CD8T cells from normal diet fed (ND), HFHC diet fed (HFHC), and resolution induced (RES) mice.
(Submitter supplied) To explore key features associated with the resolution process in liver fibrosis, we here applied a unique murine model, in which mice were fed HFHC diet for 24 weeks, and then continued with the HFHC diet (HFHC) or switched to a normal diet (RES) for 5 weeks. We noted that both the frequency and number of intrahepatic CD8+ T cells remained significantly high in RES mice compared to normal diet-fed mice (ND). more...

Identification of neural oscillations and epileptiform changes in human brain organoids
(Submitter supplied) In our study, we define neural network activities in human cortex+ganglionic eminence (GE) fusion orgaonids using a combination of calcium incator imaging and electrophysiology. We futher define abnormal network activities using fusion organoids generated from isogenic induced pluripotent stem cells containing or lacking MECP2 function derived from Rett syndrome patients. Single cell sequencing (10X genomics) was used to characterize the compositon of the fusion organoids used in our studies, and to define differentially expressed genes associated with MECP2 mutation.

Derepression of inflammation-related genes link to microglia activation and neural maturation defect in a mouse model of Kleefstra Syndrome
(Submitter supplied) Kleefstra syndrome (KS, also known as 9q.34.3 deletion syndrome) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a developmental delay, abnormal behaviors and autism-like features. This syndrome is caused by haplo-insufficiency of the euchromatin histone methyltransferase 1 gene (EHMT1/GLP/KDM1D). This gene product, GLP is a methyltransferase responsible for mono- and di-methylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 N-terminal tail, which modulates epigenetic information. more...
